# Arduino-Alarm-System-
  Description:
This is my second project for my course the introduction to robotics.This is my alarm system made in Arduino IDE.
The alarm activates in 10 seconds after pressing the 1 button. 
For detecting objects it uses an ultrasonic sensor, and once the alarm detect something a buzzer starts emitting a sound. 
In order to stop the alarm we need to insert a 4 digits password. The preset password is 1234 but we also have the possibility 
to change it.
By pressing the 2 button we enter the password change menu where first we need to enter the current password in order to 
continue and then enter the new 4 digits password.Once the password is changed, the next time we activate the alarm,
we will only be able to stop the alarmby entering the new password. If we enter a wrong password we will get a message
that we need to try again.
  
  Required Components:
   -Arduino board 
   -ultrasonic sensor 
   -LCD display
   -buzzer
   -4Ã—3 keypad.
